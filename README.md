 Irrigation Cycle System

This is a **dynamic web application** built to manage and monitor irrigation cycles efficiently. It helps in scheduling, validating, and visualizing multiple irrigation cycles using time and plot-based filters.

# Features and Functionalities

# 1. Input Validation and Error Alerts
Clear instructions are provided to help users enter valid inputs. In case of incorrect input, real-time error alerts are displayed to guide corrections.

# 3. Time Range Validation
- **Hours:** Must be between `00` and `23`
- **Minutes/Seconds:** Must be between `00` and `59`
Invalid inputs outside this range trigger error alerts.

# 4.  Time Logic Note - If Start Time Less Than End Time 
  If the **start time is earlier than the end time**, it implies that the irrigation cycle spans across **two different days**, and the total runtime will exceed **12 
  hours**. This is considered a long-duration irrigation schedule, so ensure this is intentional before submitting. It give alert.

# 5. Time Logic Note -  Start time can not be less than Current time:
- Not allowed. The app shows an alert if the start time is in the past.

# 6. ‚è± Runtime & Interval Time Constraints
- **Runtime** and **Interval** must **individually** and **combined** be < **1440 minutes** (i.e., 1 full day).
- Invalid durations will show alert messages.

# 7. Irrigation Cycle Table- Status Visibility
A detailed table shows irrigation cycle statuses such as:
- **Pending**
- **In Progress**
- **Complete**  
Each status is clearly marked and easily identifiable.

# 9. üå± Filter by Plot Number
Irrigation cycles can also be filtered based on plot numbers.
